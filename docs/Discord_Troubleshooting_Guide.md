# Discord Troubleshooting Guide

As we embark on our journey to build a thriving community on Discord, it's essential to ensure a smooth experience for all our members. Discord serves as a dynamic space for connection and collaboration, and providing comprehensive support is paramount to fostering a vibrant community environment.

To facilitate this, we have curated a troubleshooting guide to address common concerns encountered during the joining process and beyond. Whether you're new to Discord or a seasoned user, this guide aims to empower you with the knowledge needed to navigate potential hurdles effectively.

## Verification Processes:

### Expected Scenario:
If users report issues with Discord's verification processes, including captcha and browser cookies.

### Troubleshooting Steps:
- Instruct users to clear their browser cache and cookies.
- Suggest trying to join using a different browser or device.
- Advise disabling any browser extensions that may interfere with the verification process.
- Ensure users are following the correct steps provided during the verification process.

## Account Verification:

### Expected Scenario:
Users who haven't verified their account may encounter prompts to do so. Failure to verify their account could result in losing access to their username and the inability to post anything within the Discord community. Additionally, users might be periodically prompted to verify their account with features such as "I'm not a robot" or captchas, depending on their activities on Discord. Regular account verification helps maintain security and authenticity within the community.

### Troubleshooting Guide:
- Prompt users to verify their accounts promptly to avoid potential access issues.
- Provide clear instructions to users to verify their accounts to maintain access to their usernames and community posting privileges.
- Explain the importance of regular account verification and its role in maintaining security and authenticity within the Discord community.

## Multiple Accounts and IP Restrictions:

### Expected Scenario:
If users encounter issues due to Discord's policies regarding multiple accounts originating from the same IP address.

### Troubleshooting Steps:
- Advise users to log out of all Discord accounts and log back in with only one account.
- Check for any temporary bans or limitations on their account and guide them to contact Discord support if necessary.
- Ensure that no other users on the same network are using Discord simultaneously with multiple accounts.

## Server Limitations:

### Expected Scenario:
If users reach the maximum limit of 100 servers they can join, they may encounter difficulties in joining additional servers or managing their existing server memberships.

### Troubleshooting Steps:
- Encourage users to leave any servers that they no longer actively participate in to free up space for joining new servers.
- Provide guidance on organizing and prioritizing server memberships based on their interests and activities within the community.

## VPN Considerations:

### Expected Scenario:
If users encounter connectivity issues related to VPN usage.

### Troubleshooting Steps:
- Advise users to temporarily disable their VPN before creating a Discord account or joining servers.
- Verify that the VPN service being used is compatible with Discord and does not block any necessary connections.
- Recommend switching to a different VPN server location or provider if connectivity issues persist.
